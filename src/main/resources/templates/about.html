					My name is David Cady. I have been building PCs since I was a kid in elementary, playing with HTML/CSS since High School, and coding since college.<br>
					I'm also a gamer, though not the hard-core kind. I like to play casual games either alone or with friends, my favorites being Kerbal Space Program, Minecraft, and Ryzom.<br>

				<div class="m-lg-5 text-start">
					<p>KDGames is a personal project that intrigued me. While there are already some tools for Ryzom out there, many are no longer supported or updated and others are not quite as good as they could be.</p>
