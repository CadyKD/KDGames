# KDGames

This website is a combination of minigames I have created for fun and some Tools I created to help 
with an MMO called Ryzom.

Several different technologies are used:
* Springoot
* Spring Security
  * User authentication and validation 
  * BCryptPasswordEncoder
* Thymeleaf
* Lombok
* SonarLint
* Junit

Here is my ER Diagram:
